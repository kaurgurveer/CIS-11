2. 1. 5 Section Review:

1.	The CPU contains clock, control unit, and arithmetic unit. 
2.	The CPU is connected to the rest of the computer system using data, control, and address buses.
3.	Memory access takes more machine cycles than register access because it responds slowly to access requests and memory is located outside the CPU where as registers are inside the CPU.
4.	The three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle are fetch, decode, and execute.
5.	When a memory operand is used, fetch the operands and stores the result is required in the instruction execution cycle.

2. 4. 3 Section Review:

5.	The purpose of the 8259A PIC controller is that it manages external interrupts from hardware devices such as the keyboard and disk drives.

2. 5. 2 Section Review:

1.	Level 3 is the most universal and portable.
3.	Device drivers are necessary because it allows new devices to be used that could be faster.
4.	Level 1 exists between the operating system and video controller card.
5.	No, the BIOS for a computer running Windows would not be different from a computer running Linux.

2. 8 Review Questions:

7. The floating-point unit performs floating-point arithmetic.
8. 80 bits are contained in each floating-point data register. 
9. True
10. False
12. False
19. False
20. False
25. Levels 2, 1, and 0 can manipulate input/output. 
26. Game programs often send their sound directly to the sound card’s hardware ports because then they could take advantage of each card’s special features.
